# Try/Catch
The *try/catch* tool serve us to manage the errors our code can have. Imagine that a wrong user input breaks your entire program execution, or that a bad fetching to an API breaks the program too.

This can be managed with the try/catch feature.

It is easy to understand how this works. Just make a try/catch block and within the `try` block goes your regular code and the handlers in case that the try block goes bad and produce an error are writen within the `catch` block.
