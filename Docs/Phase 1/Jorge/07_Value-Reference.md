# Value and Reference
When we work with variables we need to understand well the concept of *Value* and *Reference*.

## Value
Every time we work with a value we aren't overwriting the variable value, we just have the value itself handed to the *class*, *method* or *attribute* itself.

In this example, we passed the value that `myValue` holds, but it doesn't affect the value of `myValue` itself.
