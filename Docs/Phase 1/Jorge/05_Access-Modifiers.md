# Access Modifiers

There's a way you can manage what piece of code can access certain *classes* or *methods*, and this is easily achievable by using some of the following keywords:

#### Classes
Whenever we want to use a access modifier in a class we have:

- **public:** this class will be accessible for any other class
- **default:** this class will be accessible only for other classes in the same package

> By default, not using any keyword uses `default`
