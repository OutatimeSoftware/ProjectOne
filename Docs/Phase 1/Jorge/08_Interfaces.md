# Interfaces
An *Interface* is a completely abstract class, it push us to implement its methods in our class. We can implement many interfaces in the same class.

> An abstract class is a regular class but all of it's methods are declared as abstract. When we declare a method as an abstract it doesn't need to be implemented. The implementation of the methods take place in the instanciation of the class that uses the interface.
