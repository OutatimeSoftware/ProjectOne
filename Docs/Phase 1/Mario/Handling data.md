A **HashMap** is, in addition to ArrayList, one of the most widely used of Java's pre-built data structures. The hash map is used whenever data is stored as key-value pairs, where values can be added, retrieved, and deleted using keys.

In collections such as lists, as streams of values. **Stream** is a way of going through a collection of data such that the programmer determines the operation to be performed on each value. No record is kept of the index or the variable being processed at any given time.

**Lambda expressions**

value -> value > 5

Is shorthand provided by Java for anonymous methods that do not have an "owner"
