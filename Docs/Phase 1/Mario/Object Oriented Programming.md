A class defines an objects methods and the values of instance(object) variables are object specific.

Calling a constructor with the command new causes several things to happen. First, space is reserved in the computer memory for storing object variables. Then default or initial values are set to object variables (e.g. an int type variable receives an initial value of 0). Lastly, the source code in the constructor is executed. A constructor call returns a reference to an object. A reference is information about the location of object data.
