# Programming Tips

> Nov 2, 2020

**Proceed with small steps**

Try to separate the program into several sub-problems and work on only one sub-problem at a time

Always test that the program code is advancing in the right direction, in other words: test that the solution to the sub-problem is correct

Recognize the conditions that require the program to work differently. In the example above, we needed a different functionality to test whether a word had been already entered before.

Write as "clean" code as possible

**Indent your code**

Use descriptive method and variable names

Don't make your methods too long, not even the main method

Do only one thing inside one method

Remove all copy-paste code

Replace the "bad" and unclean parts of your code with clean code

If needed, take a step back and assess the program as a whole. If it doesn't work, it might be a good idea to return into a previous state where the code still worked. As a corollary, we might say that a program that's broken is rarely fixed by adding more code to it.
