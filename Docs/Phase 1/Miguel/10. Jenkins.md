Now you can access your browser and paste this:

**127.0.0.1:8080**

And you'll have the first jenkins screen to you. It'll ask you for a password (That one that you copy from the last command I showed you in the last section).

It'll also ask you to *Intall suggested plugins* or *Select plugins to install*

When the installation of plugins finishes you'll be asked to **Create First Admin User** (Use a strong password because you love yourself).
