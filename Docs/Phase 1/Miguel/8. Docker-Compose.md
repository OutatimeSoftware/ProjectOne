# 8. Docker Compose

> Nov 14, 2020

*Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. To learn more about all the features of Compose, see the list of features.*

We'll ned this in order to install a Jenkins and compose a Container with this.

As I Use Arch I needed to install it via Package Manager just like this:

```shell
sudo pacman -S docker-compose
```
