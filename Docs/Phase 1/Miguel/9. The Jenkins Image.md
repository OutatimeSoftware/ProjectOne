# 9. The Jenkins Image

> Nov 16, 2020

Now, finally we'll install Jenkins. And off course in order to use it. We'll need a **Docker Image**:

If you google *Jenkins Image* you'll find a Docker command to download it:

```shell
docker pull jenkins/jenkins
```
You'll see that the image is downloading (This can take a while). Now you'll be able to see your images using this command:

```shell
docker images
```
You'll need to create a work directory. I've created it on my Workspace folder. I called it Jenkins. And then I worked on it.

And then we'll need to create a docker-compose.yml just like this one:

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  jenkins:
    container_name: jenkins
    image: jenkins/jenkins
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - "$PWD/jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home"
    networks:
      - net
networks:
  net:
```
And off course you'll need to create that directory and give it permissions to use it:

```shell
mkdir jenkins_home

sudo chown 1000:1000 jenkins_home -R
```
And now **Finally** we'll compose our container with this command:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```
And you can see tour server runnign with this one:

```shell
docker ps
```
