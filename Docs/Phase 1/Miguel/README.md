### The DevOps Route

> Devops is not a goal, but a never-ending process of continual improvement 

Here on my **DevOps** notes you'll be able to read all my study process and off course, all my notes (or important annotations) I made during all phase 1 of the project. We'll be focusing on a lot of topics and technologies that we'll use on our project, just as tests, devops concepts and CI/CD tools.
